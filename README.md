### Requirements

**The project is designed for the Linux operating system.**

We officially support (recent versions of) these Linux distributions:

- Ubuntu Linux
- Debian/GNU Linux

__We recommend to use server with at least 756MB RAM for gitlab-ci instance.__


__master branch contains unstable 3.0. Use 2-2-stable branch__


### How it works

__GitLab CI__ is a web application with API and connect to db. 
It manage projects/builds and provide a nice user interface. 
It uses GitLab application to authenticate users.

__GitLab CI Runner__ is a pure ruby application which process builds.
It can be deployed separately and work with GitLab CI through API.

In order to run tests you need at least 1 __GitLab CI__ instance and 1 __GitLab CI Runner__.
However, for running several builds at the same time you may want to setup more than one __GitLab CI Runner__.

Possible Cases: 

* 1 __GitLab CI__ and N __GitLab CI Runner__ instances on same machine
* 1 __GitLab CI__ and N __GitLab CI Runner__ instances on different machines
* 1 __GitLab CI__ and N __GitLab CI Runner__ instances on local machines
